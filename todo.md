Apply renv
  - This will be done to define the R environment so the packages needed to
    execute this code will be correctly defined.

Apply docker
  - This will be done because with renv there is not a good way to restict the
    R version so Docker will be used for that

Submit to Github 
  - Title of the repository will be PCA and CCA (Exploratory methods?!)
